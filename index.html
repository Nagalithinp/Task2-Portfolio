            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Lithin, a third-year B.Tech student majoring in CSE at KLU. With a passion for technology and innovation, I am dedicated to honing my skills in web development and software engineering. Over the past few years, I have gained practical experience through various projects and internships, allowing me to develop a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other modern web technologies.

                
                <br /><br />I am particularly interested in creating user-friendly and responsive web applications that solve real-world problems. My coursework and hands-on projects have equipped me with a strong understanding of the software development lifecycle, from initial design to deployment. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working on teams to bring creative solutions to life.
                
                <br /><br />When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, participating in hackathons, or contributing to open-source projects. I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges that push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills.
                
                <br /><br />Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I have worked on and learn more about my journey in the tech world. If you'd like to get in touch, don't hesitate to reach out through the contact section below.</p>
